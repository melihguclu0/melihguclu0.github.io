I've always had a passion for observing how machines work. However, my journey into engineering truly began when I discovered the fascinating world of state machines and digital electronics. From that moment, I decided to explore every layer of the fieldâ€”from logic circuits to graphical user interfaces. Along the way, I encountered many tools that were costly, which led me to the open-source and Linux ecosystems. This was a pivotal moment in my journey, revealing the familiarities that bind all things in the digital world.

This site is dedicated to sharing my research and insights on a wide range of engineering topics, with a primary focus on, but not limited to, electronics, computers, and programming.
